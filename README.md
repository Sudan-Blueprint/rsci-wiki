# Rural Social Industrial Complex (RSIC) Wiki

![RSIC Logo](assets/images/rsic-logo.png)

The **Rural Social Industrial Complex (RSIC) Wiki** is a public, replicable knowledge base for **community-driven rural industrialization in Sudan**.\
It documents the vision, roadmap, facilities, factories, shared resources, and replication model of the RSIC initiative ‚Äî designed to serve as a **blueprint for scaling industrial transformation** across the country.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üåç What is RSIC?

The RSIC model aims to: - Leverage **local resources** (agriculture, minerals, human capital) for value-added production. - Establish **factories and shared facilities** that create jobs and strengthen communities. - Provide **training and research centers** to ensure sustainability, quality, and innovation. - Act as a **replicable unit** for rural revival and industrial growth across Sudan.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üìñ Wiki Structure

The documentation site (built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)) is organized into:

-   [**Introduction**](intro/index.qmd)**:** Vision, philosophy, and strategy.\
-   [**Roadmap**](roadmap/index.qmd)**:** Phases, milestones, and next steps.\
-   [**Facilities**](facilities/index.qmd)**:** Site profile, utilities, and layout.\
-   [**Factories**](factories/index.qmd)**:** Catalogue of proposed factories with detailed templates.\
-   [**Shared Resources**](shared/index.qmd)**:** Industrial Transformation Technical Center (ITTC), research, labs, logistics, training.\
-   [**Replication Model**](replication/index.qmd)**:** Practical steps, checklists, and policy guidance to replicate RSICs in other cities.
